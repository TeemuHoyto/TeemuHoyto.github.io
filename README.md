# Read me of my portfolio :) 

To whom it may concern :)
This portfolio lists sites and web apps that I have made in my time as a web developer.
The index.html file contains the main markup and a JS function gets the data from other folders.
I wanted to keep the project easy to edit so the stucture is as simple as possible.
