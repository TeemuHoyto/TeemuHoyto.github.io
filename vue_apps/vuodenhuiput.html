  <li><span>The main app contains three different apps. I made two of them.</span></li>
  <li><span>The first one I made was an app that lists users entries, the company user has created or is part of and the
      company entries.</span></li>
  <li><span>Here user can add more users to their company edit the company. They can also send the entries to
      woocommerce to be paid.</span></li>
  <li><span>The largest of the apps is the jury app that allows the jury members and secretary to jury the
      entries.</span></li>
  <li><span>The app saves the data that each the jury members have made.</span></li>
  <li><span>The app has multiple phaises and the data is parsed through and categories are given to the entries.</span></li>
  <li><span>In the final phaise the awards are set to the entries.</span></li>
  <li><span>Site has a small app that shoes the <a href="https://vuodenhuiput.fi/work/">old winners</a>.</span></li>
