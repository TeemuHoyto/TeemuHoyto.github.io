<h3>About vue and rest apis</h3>
<ul>
  <li><span><a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue</a> is an amazing js tool. I love its simplicity.</span></li>
  <li><span>I have used Axios to get the data from the rest endpoints</span></li>
  <li><span>Every app has one or more rest endpoints that they make calls to and get the correct data.</span></li>
  <li><span>Some have user rights checks and other do multiple checks and return errors or correct data if rights
      match.</span></li>
