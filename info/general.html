<p>Hello,</p> <br><br>
<p>I'm currently employed at <a href="https://redandblue.fi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RedandBlue</a>
  as a senior web developer.<br><br>
  Previous employer was <a href="https://www.paperplanes.fi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Paperplanes</a>
  and I was there for 3 years.</p>
<br><br>
<p><strong>Skills:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Rest apis</li>
  <li>Integrations</li>
  <li>Vue.js</li>
  <li>JS</li>

  <li>SCSS</li>
  <li>Wordpress</li>
  <li>Woocommerce</li>
  <li>Git</li>
</ul>
<br><br>
<p>
  I mostly work with Wordpress, Vue.js and rest apis. I have a lot of experience with integrations and I have built many
  interesting and fast web apps that display that data in a user friendly way.<br><br>

  <strong>Trivia:</strong><br>
  In my free time I build legos with my son and practice woodworking and welding.<br>

  As a person I love spending time in the forrest and I'm a big fan of nature. I enjoy reading superb scifi books and my
  alltime favourite is Hyperion Cantos by Dan Simmons.<br>

  I'm 38 years old, married and have one microman running around the house. We currenty live in Tuusula in a wooden cube
  built in 1954 with sawdust hidden under the floors and inside the walls. I have a five year plan that involves moving
  closer to a lake for everyday swimming.<br><br>
