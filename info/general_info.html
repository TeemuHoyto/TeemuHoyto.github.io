<p>Hello, <br><br>
  I'm currently employed at <a href="https://redandblue.fi/" target="_blank"

  Previous employer was <a href="https://www.paperplanes.fi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Paperplanes</a>
  and was there for 3 years.
  <br><br>I do web development with WP, PHP, JS, SCSS
  and
  Vue.js. Git is one of my close friends and I seek more
  acquaintances as I move towards my inevitable demise. If you have any questions or wish to know
  more

  or a random encounter.<br><br> Trivia:<br> I'm 36 years old, married and have one microman
  running around the
  house.<br>I enjoy sunshine, outdoors and nature.<br>
  We currenty live in Tuusula in a wooden cube built in 1954 with sawdust hidden under the floors
  and inside
  the walls.<br>
  I have a five year plan that involves moving closer to a lake for everyday swimming.<br>
  On my freetime I build legos with Microman and practice woodworking and welding.<br>
  I enjoy reading superb scifi books and my alltime favourite is Hyperion Cantos by Dan
  Simmons.<br>
