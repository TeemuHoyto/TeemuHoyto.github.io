<ul>
  <li><span>Visual Components sells a factory design software and they needed a functional
      website to portray their product.
    </span></li>
  <li><span>This was an interesting project as most of the posts were imported from the old
      site.</span></li>
  <li><span>This site uses custom Gutenberg blocks.</span></li>
  <li><span>GDPR tool Cookiepro is used on this site.</span></li>
  <li><span>I made a JS "cookie checker" that checks if cookies have been accepted. If
      cookies have not been accepted it shows a box that instructs users to accept cookies on top of Youtube
      videos.</span></li>
