  <li><span>Migri is the Finnish goverments imigration agency.</span></li>
  <li><span>I made a web app that contains lots of questions and options to choose from.</span></li>
  <li><span>Users answers are saved to local storage and user can print them in the end of the app.</span></li>
  <li><span>The app has been added to multiple websites as an iframe.</span></li>
  <li><span>Working in finland has the app on their site and the link is above.</span></li>
  <li><span>This was a super fun WP project.</span></li>
  <li><span>Each one of the views is one page and it links to the next one that is set in the page settings.</span></li>
