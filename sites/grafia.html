<ul>
  <li><span>I was lead developper in this project.</span></li>
  <li><span>Grafia is a Association of Visual Communication Designers in Finland.</span></li>
  <li><span>The site has a public side and an itranet for members.</span></li>
  <li><span>The site has an integration to gruppo to fetch and update user data.</span></li>
  <li><span>I made a vue app that uses the integration to fetch user data and update the data user wishes to change.</span></li>
  <li><span>Users can view blog posts and news and if user logs in they have another set for members.</span></li>
  <li><span>Users can add posts and events to the event calendar.</span>
  <li><span>I also made regular development and the members vue app.</span></li>
  <li><span>Admin can change the colors of the site to change the style of the Luonnos pages</span></li>
  <li><span>A superb project that turned out well.</span></li>
